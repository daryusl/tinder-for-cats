# tinder-for-cats

Cinder
A "dating app for pets"; used by pet owners to set up playdates for their pets. Our submission to nwHacks 2020, made with:

React Native
Firebase
Inspiration
In the same way as humans, pets should be able to make new friends or meet potential partners in a safe environment.

What it does
Cinder gives pet owners the opportunity to meet other pet owners who have pets looking for a playdate. They can choose which pets they think would be compatible, and if the other user thinks the same way, a chat will be made available for them.

What's next for Cinder
Make "swiping right" the action which triggers a match between two users
Make it more user friendly from signing up to getting their first message
